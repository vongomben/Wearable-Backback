Each user was asked to choose different designs that were lately being lasercutted. You can see the designs in the \"Cover Designs\" Folder of this repository (or in the Zipped folder) or in the final pictures. Basic assembly of the cover and of the backpacks in the end of our first lesson.\r\n\r\n![cover lasercutting](http://i.imgur.com/MOYuCXi.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Intro to Arduino\r\n\r\nThe idea behind the workshop was enpowering non-technical wearable tinkerers in the creation of this interactive backpack. The \"control unit\" is a glove, with index/middle/ring/thumb fingers respectively sewed on pin 3, 10, 11 and GND on the [Lilypad Arduino USB](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardLilyPadUSB). A Strip made of 8 [WS2812b RGB Adressable LEDs](http://store.arduino.cc/product/C000083) is hooked up to pin 9, controlled using [Adafruit Neopixel Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel). \r\n\r\n![final circuit](http://i.imgur.com/xkyN14P.png)\r\n\r\nGeneral knowledge of the lilypad and Arduino in general ranged on the Arduino Alphabet (aka [digitalWrite](http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/digitalWrite), [digitalRead](http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/digitalRead), [AnalogRead](http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/analogRead), [AnalogWrite](http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/analogWrite), a basic use of the [Serial Port](http://arduino.cc/en/Serial/Println) and [Pull-ups](http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/InputPullupSerial).\r\nAs part of the kit, we've been also toying around [Analog Pressure Sensor](http://scuola.arduino.cc/lesson/ZloY9Ao/Analog_textile_press_button_tutorial) from [Plug'n'Wear](http://www.plugandwear.com/).\r\n\r\n### Arduino and Assembly: The Glove\r\n\r\nLong (1m) 4 pin flat cables were tied and then sewed to the \"control\" fingers (in this case, index/middle/ring/thumb). [Donductive Thread](http://store.arduino.cc/product/E000032) will lately tie the final copper part of the cable to the fingertips. Long process, short description.\r\n\r\n![Glove in its work in progress](http://i.imgur.com/IG6rphG.jpg)\r\n\r\nOn the same lesson, the other side of the cables were soldered to male snap connectors.\r\n\r\n![Soldering the Snap Coonnectors](http://i.imgur.com/TZaHMvH.jpg)\r\n\r\nFemale Snap connectors were soldered on the lilypad, à la [Lilypad Simple Snap](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoLilyPadSimpleSnap), as well as battery pack. You might enquire why we haven't used lithium batteries: LED consumption and battery life made us choose for 4 rechargable, NI-MH 1.2V batteries. I'll update this guide if I'll be proven wrong.\r\n\r\n![Snaps!](http://i.imgur.com/yrkEmsR.png)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
